<b>Sonobe</b> is a modular library to fold circuit instances in an Incremental Verifiable computation (IVC) style. It features multiple folding schemes and decider setups, allowing users to pick the scheme which best fit their needs. <b>Sonobe</b> also provides a way for developers to generate an EVM-verifiable zkSNARK proof of correct folding.

Sonobe is conceived as an exploratory effort with the aim to push forward the practical side of folding schemes and advancing towards onchain (EVM) verification.

<i>"The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonobe">Sonobe module</a> is one of the many units used to build modular origami. The popularity of Sonobe modular origami models derives from the simplicity of folding the modules, the sturdy and easy assembly, and the flexibility of the system."</i>


> **Warning**: experimental code, do not use in production.<br>
> The code has not been audited. Several optimizations are also pending. Our focus so far has been on implementing the Nova + CycleFold proving system and achieving onchain (EVM) verification.

### Overview of sonobe

Sonobe is a modular library to fold R1CS instances in an Incremental Verifiable computation (IVC) style. It also provides the tools required to generate a zkSNARK out of an IVC proof and to verify it on Ethereum's EVM.

All users have to do is to: 

1. Design an input circuit
2. Chooses a folding scheme (e.g. Nova)
3. Pick a final decider (e.g. Spartan over Pasta curve).

In fact, which folding scheme and decider is chosen *does not matter*. Indeed, with a few lines of code, users can always change their folding scheme and final decider (e.g. switching from a Decider that uses two Spartan proofs to a Decider that uses a single Groth16 to be verified in an Ethereum smart contract).

This project builds on top of the [arkworks](https://github.com/arkworks-rs) libraries, and uses the Espresso's [virtual polynomial](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/hyperplonk/blob/main/arithmetic/src/virtual_polynomial.rs) abstraction and the [SumCheck](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/hyperplonk/tree/main/subroutines/src/poly_iop/sum_check) implementation.
The Solidity templates used in the nova_cyclefold_verifier.sol, use a Groth16 Solidity template which comes from [iden3](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs/blob/master/templates/verifier_groth16.sol.ejs), and a KZG10 Solidity template which is adapted from [weijiekoh/libkzg](https://github.com/weijiekoh/libkzg).
